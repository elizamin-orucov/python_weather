# Python Weather

If you wish, you can use the weather project I made with Python.

## Description

I made a simple weather project with Python.
In my project, I used the API document of the
https://openweathermap.org website to get information
about the weather. For the project to run, log in to the
openweathermap.org website and type the key given to you in
My API keys instead of your-api-key. After running the project,
all you have to do is type the city name in the window that opens
and click the search button.

# Installation and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elizamin-orucov/python_weather.git .
pip install -r requirements.txt
python home.py
```
